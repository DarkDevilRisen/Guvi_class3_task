Copy by value
In a primitive data-type when a variable is assigned a value we can imagine that a box is created in the memory. This box has a sticker attached to it i.e. the variable name. Inside the box the value assigned to the variable is stored.

Copy by reference
In case of a non-primitive data-type the values are not directly copied. When a non-primitive data-type is assigned a value a box is created with a sticker of the name of the data-type. However, the values it is assigned is not stored directly in the box. The language itself assigns a different memory location to store the data. The address of this memory location is stored in the box created.
